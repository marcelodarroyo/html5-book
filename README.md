# html5-book

Simple editor/player interactive story book.

## To do list

1. Attaching and playing sounds to images and sprites.
2. Adding text to images. This missing function can be bypassed adding pre-edited images (with Gimp or Inkscape) and adding to gallery.
3. When playing, on click on images or sprites, jump to corresponding page (it is the attribute gotoPage of images and sprites).
4. In playing mode, resize canvas to full screen and hide edition bars (gallery and pages).
5. A better css (the actual one sucks)
6. Fix bug when selecting rotated object (I think it is in geometry.js)
7. Test on Firefox and Chrome
